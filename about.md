---

I am Chinmoy Ranjan Pradhan. I am an amateur C++ developer based in Bangalore, India. I am curretly enrolled at 
Dr. Ambedkar Institue of Technology, Bangalore for a bachelor's degree in computer science. In my spare time I 
like to hone my programming skills. When I am not programming I read books, play volleyball, complete my college 
assignments and day-dream.
